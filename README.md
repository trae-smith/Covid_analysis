# Covid_analysis
A mini project I made to analyze the cases, deaths, and vaccinations in NA. The dataset used was "Our World in Data Covid Dataset" (https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv). I wanted to know the trends specifically for the vaccinations across NA, as well as the amount of cases and deaths compared to each country's population. I also wanted to maintain my skills in R.
